				<h2>About the Music legend</h2>
				
				<ul>
								<li><strong>1983: </strong>Fela was born on the 15th  of October, 1938 in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. With his birth name as <strong>Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti.</strong></li><br>
								<li><strong>1958: </strong> He attended Abeokuta Grammar School in Abeokuta, and in 1958, he traveled to London to study medicine, instead he studied music at Trinity College of Music, London.He formed the band Koola Lobitos and played a fusion of jazz and highlife, while he chose <em><strong>"Trumpet",</strong></em> as his preferred instrument.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1960:</strong> Kuti married his first wife, Remilekun (Remi) Taylor in 1960, with whom he had three children (Femi, Yeni, and Sola)</li><br>
								<li><strong>1963: </strong> He moved back to Nigeria, re-formed Koola Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. He also played for some time with Victor Olaiya and his All Stars.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1967: </strong> He went to Ghana in 1967 in search of a new musical direction.That was where and when Kuti first called his music <em><strong>"Afrobeat"</strong></em>.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1969: </strong>Kuti took the band to the United States (Los Angeles), where they spent 10 months. While there, he discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now called Sandra Izsadore), a partisan of the Black Panther Party. This experience heavily influenced his music and political views.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1970: </strong> Fela and his band returned to Nigeria in 1970, the group was renamed <strong> "The Afrika '70"</strong>, as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues.He then formed the <em><strong>Kalakuta Republic;</strong> </em> a commune, a recording studio, and a home for the many people connected to the band, which he later declared independent from the Nigerian State.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1972: </strong>In 1972, Ginger Baker recorded 'Stratavarious' with Fela alongside Bobby Tench. Around this time, Kuti became even more involved in the Yoruba religion.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1977: </strong>In 1977, Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album <strong>'Zombie'</strong>, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash hit and infuriated the Nigerian government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic, where one thousand soldiers attacked the commune. Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly mother was thrown from a window, causing her, fatal injuries.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1978: </strong> Fela Kuti married 27 women, many of whom were his dancers, composers, and singers to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic. He later adopted a rotation system of keeping only 12 simultaneous wives.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1979: </strong> After which Kuti's candidature was refused as the Nigerian president for over a decade, Fela created a new band called <strong>"Egypt '80"</strong> (reflecting his reading of pan-African literature). He continued to record albums and tour the country. He further infuriated the political establishment by dropping the names of ITT Corporation vice-president Moshood Abiola and then General Olusegun Obasanjo at the end of a hot-selling 25 mins political screed entitled <em><strong>"I.T.T. (International Thief-Thief)"</strong></em>.</li><br>
								<li><strong>1997: </strong>Fela Kuti died on 2nd August 1997 at the age of 58 in Lagos State, Nigeria.</li>	<br>
